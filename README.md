This is my **first Python project**  
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game you can play in the terminal. Built to practice Python basics.

**How to Run?**
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the file: 'rps.py'
3. Run it in the terminal with:
'''bash
python rps.py


**Gameplay FeaturesðŸŽ®**
Play against the computer,
Win/loss/tie logic,
Random computer choices,
Clean input validation using Enums.


**What I Learned:**
Basic Python syntax,
Enum class,
input() and print(),
Conditional logic (if/elif/else),
Random number generation.


**Ideas for Future:**
Add a GUI (Tkinter or Pygame),
Add score tracking,
Make it replayable,
Deploy on the web with Flask or Replit.
